# RanGen

## Random number generator

The app helps to obtain random uniform numbers in an interval defined by the user.

Currently, there are 3 options:

* Non-negative integers.
* Non-negative decimals.
* Binary numbers.

## Motivation

The main reason behind this project is to learn Kotlin, since I already have some experience as Android Dev. Another motive that I have is that I'd may need it in a future.

## Future work

1. Fix show/hide configuration layouts' bug when user taps quickly between options in configuration screen.
2. Validate input. User can break the app easily.
3. Add an option to obtain a list of numbers instead of just one.
4. Add probability distributions.
5. Add "About" screen.
6. Generate and upload an APK.
7. Upload app to Play Store for free.
8. Depurate UI.
9. Improve UX.
10. Add more visual efects.
